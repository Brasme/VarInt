# VarInt - Any number of bytes (variable integer) represented math

Not made for performance but a example on "how to" implement math on any size integers, https://github.com/Brasme/VarInt

Note: 
- Math operations seems to be ok - but test it!!
- Missing: Div(),Sqrt(),Power(),Exp(),Ln(), Sin(),Cos(), etc..may implement it when needed. 

If you have contributions, feel free :)
