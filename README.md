# VarInt - Any number of bytes (variable integer) represented math

Not made for performance but a example on "how to" implement math on any size integers, https://github.com/Brasme/VarInt

Supports basic binary and mathematical operations (>>,<<, !,^,~,&,|,+,-,*,/)


Note: 
- Math operations seems to be ok - add more unit tests if used

If you have contributions, feel free :)
